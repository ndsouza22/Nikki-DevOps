            <h2>Fixed-Rate Loan</h2>
            <p>With a fixed-rate loan, your interest rate remains constant throughout the loan term. This offers stability and predictability in your monthly payments.</p>
            <p>Interest Rate: 3.5%</p>
            <p>Loan Term: 30 years</p>

            <h2>Adjustable-Rate Loan</h2>
            <p>An adjustable-rate loan, also known as a variable-rate loan, has an interest rate that may change periodically based on market conditions. Initial rates are usually lower than fixed-rate loans.</p>
            <p>Initial Interest Rate: 2.75%</p>
            <p>Loan Term: 30 years</p>

        <div class="loan-option">
            <h2>Government-Backed Loan</h2>
            <p>Government-backed loans, such as FHA loans, VA loans, or USDA loans, are insured by the government, which reduces the risk for lenders and may offer benefits such as lower down payment requirements.</p>
            <p>Interest Rate: Varies</p>
            <p>Loan Term: Varies</p>
